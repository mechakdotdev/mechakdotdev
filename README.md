## ü¶¶ About Me

<br>
I'm a rookie Software Developer triyng to put all my projects together in one place to show where I've been, where I'm at and where I'm headed as far as coding is concerned. Currently I'm working in C# as well as other tech (Angular, Entity Framework, SQL) as part of the full-stack development I do at work.
<br><br>
A couple of my interests:
- Object-oriented programming
- Web development
- Open source software (hoping to start contributing)
<br><br>
